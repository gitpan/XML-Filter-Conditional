Revision history for XML-Filter-Conditional

0.02    BUGFIXES:
         * Declare dependency on XML::SAX::ParserFactory because it doesn't
           automatically come with XML::SAX::Base
         * Don't reuse the parser in t/20exceptions.t because XML::SAX::Expat
           has a bug if reused in this way; reconstruct fresh one each time.
         * 'use constant' in a perl 5.6-compatible way.

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
